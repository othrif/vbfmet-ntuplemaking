# Docker configuration.
#
# The configuration needs to be a bit elaborate, as it has to work correctly
# both as part of the CI build, and when used "standalone".
#  - When used as part of the CI, it picks up the RPM file that was produced
#    by one of the previous build steps, and installs that into the output
#    image.
#  - When used outside of the CI, it builds the code of the repository itself,
#    producing an RPM file in the process, and then installs that RPM file on
#    the system.
#

# Set up which image we base the analysis repository's image on.

# Switch to the root user, as the source directory at this point can only be
# modified with super user priviliges.
USER root

# If this included an RPM file as well, then we're running as part of the CI
# system, and we'll just use that RPM file. But if not, then the image build
# has to produce the RPM file itself.
